# UnityHelper
 Library for handling Il2Cpp UnityEngine class calls

## Purpose

The purpose of this library is to convert the standard Unity Library Scripting API into a library that can easily be used with Il2CppLib to make it easier to make changes to android based Unity games (for modding purposes of course).
